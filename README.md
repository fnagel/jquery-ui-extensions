[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - Extensions
================================

This repository is not actively maintained. It works with whatever version of
jQuery UI is used in the demos. There are no tests and I don't use any of these
in any of my code anywhere. Individual extensions may or may not work with newer
version of jQuery UI.


What is this?
---
Some script which extend jQuery UI widgets with additional functionality.

If you're looking for the `pop-up style` extension for selectmenu, check the
[selectmenu branch](https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui-extensions/tree/selectmenu).
